This is basically 2 compilers:
1. a small subset of Haskell in strict form to GCC
2. a small subset of Javascript to GHC

To run:
- Go to the code dir
- Run "cabal build"
- Run "dist/build/compile/compile"

Then the file lambdaman.hs in the solution dir is compiled to lambdaman.gcc,
and the ghost0.js file is compiled to ghost0.ghc.
